# Pip

Pip is a Eurorack module containing two morphable CV generators/complex LFOs in 8 HP that can be synced to each other in predefined ratios, unsynced or phase-shifted between each other. The user can choose from a large variety of preset waveforms, random waves or record and morph their own external CV or knob movements. Pip is based on the popular ATTiny85 microcontroller: https://neutral-labs.com/pip
